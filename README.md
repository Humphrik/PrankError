# PrankError
Play it on your cheeky friends.

## What is it
PrankError is a Java program that when run, shows an error message to the user.
This should make the user think that the program does not work. The program will
continue to run in the background and it will play a music file included in the
.jar file.

## Where can I get it
PrankError is open source and available to everyone for free on Github.com:
